    </div>
    <div class="text text-justify">
        <p>Presenting mesmerizing scenic beauty, Laknavaram Lake is undoubtedly one of the most sought after tourist attractions in Warangal.
             Spread over an area of 10,000 acres, this huge spread of serene water promises a perfect break, away from the chaos and pollution of cities.</p>

            <p>Surrounded by lush green forests and captivating hillocks, this lake is sure to leave you enchanted. 
                The twisty road, with forests on both sides and the lake makes even the journey memorable. 
                The hanging bridge and small islands that are scattered around add further to its enthralling scenic beauty.
                 Not only scenic beauty, this lake is historically significant as well.
                 A fine example of engineering excellence during Kakatiya Reign, Laknavaram Lake is a beautiful blend of history with nature.
            </p>
            <p>What make this lake even more alluring are the mini islands that are located all around it. A total of about 13 tiny pieces of land can be seen surrounded by lake water, 
                especially during the month of monsoon. The view during morning at sunrise when the lake water shine as the rays fall through the trees is absolutely stunning.</p>

                <p>At a distance of around 75 km from Warangal Laknavaram Lake is located in the Laknavaram village in the Govindaraopet Mandal. From Hyderabad it is located around 150 km away. As it is located quite close to Ramappa Temple, which is 29 km away, both the places can be clubbed together and visited on the same day.

                    Although this lake is ideal for visiting throughout the year, the best time to visit Laknavaram Lake is during the monsoon and winter season. During these months, many tourists plan Warangal tour and visit this lake as well. As in rainy season, the lake is filled with water and the surrounding area also sees more of freshly grown flora.</p>

    <div> <h1 class=" hd2 font-weight-bold mt-4 py-4 text-justify">History of Laknavaram Lake</h1>
    <p>The history of Laknavaram Lake goes back to Kakatiya reign. Also known as Laknavaram Cheruvu, this lake was
         first discovered by the Kakatiya rulers. They found a beautiful lake lying amid flourishing hills that 
         surrounded it. It was then the rulers of Kakatiya reign built a small sluice gate that eventually transformed
          it into vast lake that now serve as water reservoir. Laknavaram Lake still serves as a source of irrational 
          water for an area of around 3,500 acres of land, to six villages that are located nearby.
         It has the capacity to hold around 2.135 tmc ft. of water.</p>
