    </div>
    <div class="text text-justify">
        <p>Charminar is a square-shaped structure built out of granite and lime mortar. The monument predominantly has an Islamic-style design, but influences of Hindu architecture can also be seen in its ornamentation. It is flanked by four minarets on every corner which are 48.7 meters high. It is believed that the four minarets are symbolic of Islam’s first four Khalifas. Each minaret is four stories tall, and the floors are divided by beautifully carved rings around it. The mosque is located on the top floor, and visitors can enjoy a short climb of the 149 steps to get there.</p>

            <p>The reason behind building such an architectural marvel remains unclear, though it is widely accepted that the Charminar was built to commemorate the eradication of the plague which was widespread during that period in the city. According to Jean de Thévenot, a French traveler of the 17th century whose narration was complemented with the available Persian texts, the construction was done to celebrate the beginning of the second Islamic millennium year. Others have come to believe that the king erected the structure at the very spot where he first laid his eyes on his future begum (wife), Bhagmati.


            </p>
            <p>The first floor was used as a madarasa (college) during the Qutub Shahi period. The second floor has a mosque on the western side, the dome of which is visible from the road, if one stands some distance away. A spectacular view of the city may be had from the roof of the Charminar, although, due to severe overcrowding of the minarets, only visitors with special permission from the Archaeological Survey of India, Hyderabad Circle are allowed to go to the top of the minarets. The clocks above each of the four archways were added in 1889.

            </p>

                <p>Walking around the Charminar area, one is constantly surprised by vestiges of the past intermingling with the present. Towards the Southeast of the Charminar is located imposing edifice of the Nizamia Unani Hospital. About 50m to the West, the line of shops in Lad Bazaar is interrupted by an old, crumbling brown wall, which marks the entrance to the old Nizama's Jilau Khana (parade ground). The grounds are now being used for the development of a large commercial complex. Further down, a road to the left leads to the Khilawat Complex (Chowmahalla Palace). The Lad Bazaar road terminates in a square called Mahaboob Chowk where a large 19th century clock-tower looms over a delicate white mosque of the same period.
